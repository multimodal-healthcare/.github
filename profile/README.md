The basic idea is to: 

Use pre-trained models that are publicly available for each modality of healthcare data - e.g. X-Ray, MRI, clinical notes, etc.
For actual Electronic Health Record (EHR) data (which is structured / tabular data) we can use my previous work - lemonpie if a better one is not publicly available.
And put them together using one or more of the techniques detailed in this document to predict on data in the ‘Coherent Dataset’ (and a smaller summary here).
